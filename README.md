WP Developers Facebook Instant Articles
===

Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that creates an RSS feed for Facebook Instant Articles. I include options for Facebook Network Audience ads, placed automatically, as well as Google Analytics tracking codes using custom group tracking. You can find my feed, once I'm activated, at yoursite.com/feed/instant/

Getting Started
---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the WPDev FBIA options page to configure the plugin.
